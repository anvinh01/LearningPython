# Remember there are multiple Solutions.
# It is more important to experiment and get a deeper understanding.
# In this exercise you can also try to write down multiple solutions

# ===============================================================
# 3.0:
# first write down an input("Exercise Number")
# depending on the input number we will run the Exercise number
# input:
# 2
# output:
# call the Exercise 3.2

# 3.1:
# write a loop which prints out all even numbers from (10, 30)
# try to write 2 different approaches

# 3.2:
# write the fibonacci sequence down.
# fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 33, 54
# the sequence from 1 to 100

# Write an input
# calculate the falkut√§t from the number
