# Python introduction
<b>To all people who are interested in learning Python</b>.
I created an Introduction into Python, to the best of my abilities for you.
At the end of this, you should be able to understand the basics of Python and develop an intuition for programming.

I will provide little exercises to work on, so you can try to code yourself.

My final goal is to teach you all the tools needed for Data Science.
I may not be able to teach you everything, but hopefully you can develop a basis, which will help you understand the module much faster.
The Repository is still incomplete, but will be Updated with each learning session
If any problems occur or questions arrise, you are free to ask me.
